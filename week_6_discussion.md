## Hacking *Moby-Dick*, Week 6 (22 May)

### Week 6 Discussion

First, a demo on using digital resources to understand Melville's use of Thomas Beale's *Natural History of the Sperm Whale*.

1. Download [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/).

2. Download the plain text files of [*Moby-Dick*](moby-dick.txt) and [Beale](beale-natural-history-sperm-whale.txt).

3. Open AntConc and select File > Open File(s). Select the *Moby-Dick* and Beale text files you just downloaded.

4. Select Concordance on AntConc's interface. Select a search term (we started with "whale"), then click "Start".
