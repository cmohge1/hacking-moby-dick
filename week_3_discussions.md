## Hacking *Moby-Dick*, Week 3

### Week 3 Discussion

*From Chapter 35, "The Mast-Head"*:

"There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the
drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.
For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime unevent-
fulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;
bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the
thought of what you shall have for dinnerâ€”for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your
bill of fare is immutable."
