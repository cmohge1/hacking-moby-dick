## Hacking *Moby-Dick*, Week 3

### Week 3 Discussion

*From Chapter 35, "The Mast-Head"*:

"There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the
drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.
For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime unevent-
fulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;
bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the
thought of what you shall have for dinnerâ€”for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your
bill of fare is immutable. ...

"There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life impart-
ed by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea;
by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. But while this
sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch,
slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror.
Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day,
in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop
through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to
rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!"
