## Hacking *Moby-Dick*, Week 2

### Passages Discussed

*From Chapter 2:*

It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one
side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a
sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon
kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's
tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant
zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly
toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called
Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
only copy extant—“It maketh a marvellous difference, whether
thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all
on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless
window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the
wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I, as
this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reason-
est well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine
is the house. What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and
the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.
But it's too late to make any improvements now. The universe
is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off
a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth
against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters
with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and
put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out
the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in
his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh,
pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what
northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes
of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making
my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by
holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not
Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far
rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator;
yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep
out this frost?
Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone
before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an
iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives
himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen
sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only
drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling,
and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice
from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter”
may be.
