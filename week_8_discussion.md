## Hacking *Moby-Dick*, Week 8 (5 June)

### Week 8 Discussion

First, a demo on using R to create a lexical dispersion plot based on the [sentiment words](moby-dick-sentiment.html) of *Moby-Dick*.

[Enter the R markdown document on lexical dispersion plots.](R-demo-2-lex-disp.html)

Another R demo: build a key-word-in-context search.

#### More about R

To learn more about R, I would suggest starting with this helpful [tutorial by Jeff Rydberg-Cox](https://daedalus.umkc.edu/StatisticalMethods/index.html).

Then I would work through Matthew Jockers's [*Text Analysis in R for Students of Literature*](http://www.matthewjockers.net/text-analysis-with-r-for-students-of-literature/) (2014).

Finally, the [R WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming) and [R home page]() are loaded with good information.
